## Case Study (PLEASE READ BEFORE WORKSHOP #3)

Louis Vuitton (LV) is planning an exhibition "SERIES 88" in Beijing on January 8, 2019. This very VIP event will feature [Nicolas Ghesqui√®re](https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/nicolas-ghesquiere) (art director) and other high profile fashionistas in attendance. Lucky few guests will indulge a night of glamour and champagne üçæ

LV team decided to selectively invite their top chinese customers (only high net worth) through a **WeChat interactive flyer** for **SIGN UP** 1 month prior, and **CHECK IN** (on site). 

Thanks to its creative capabilities and *strong technical acumen*, **DLG agency works with LV on a retainer basis**. You have been tasked to come up with the most efficient tech solution for this event registration process. LV wants to combine a beautiful flyer for SIGN UP through WeChat as well as a smooth process for security CHECK IN.

It's time for you to prepare for the proposal and convince LV China team as well as all possible stakeholders in the meeting room.

During the project briefing meeting, we could see LV team was internally unsure of the best direction: should this ticketing tool *designed and built totally from scratch*? or use *an existing software as a service*? or perhaps an *hybrid solution (API as back-end + custom front-end?)*. On this question, you will have to come up with your recommendation and justify it.

### Assessment

Your business unit will be scored on your ability to clearly define:
- Project specifications (10 points): SMART goals and prototype
- Solution recommendation (10 points): how + why
- Project planning & workflow (10 points)

### Deliverable
- 10 minutes presentation, 3 minutes Q&A
- Max 5 slides
- FIGMA mockups

 ‚ö†Ô∏è **No need to start working on this case** before Saturday October 27, as the afternoon is allocated for this group work.
